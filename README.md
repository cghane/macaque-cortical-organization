# macaque-cortical-organization
A compendium of the MATLAB functions I used in my analysis pipeline for integrating functional connectivity gradients, intrinsic neural timescales, and neurotransmitter receptor distributions in resting-state macaque fMRI data. Includes atlas transformations, gradient mapping, timescale segmentation, and cross-scale chemotemporal analyses used in my associated manuscript.
