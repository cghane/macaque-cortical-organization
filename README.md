# macaque-cortical-organization
A compendium of the MATLAB functions I used in my analysis pipeline for integrating functional connectivity gradients, intrinsic neural timescales, and neurotransmitter receptor distributions for resting-state macaque fMRI data in my paper “Toward a Unified Model of the Macaque Cortex with Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal-Neurochemical Integration." Includes atlas transformations, gradient mapping, timescale segmentation, and cross-scale chemotemporal analyses used in my associated manuscript.
